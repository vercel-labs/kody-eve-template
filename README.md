Kody is a personal GitHub maintainer agent built on [eve](https://eve.dev), made for freelancers, solo maintainers, and anyone who runs a repo alongside everything else. Every Monday it emails you a digest of your repo's open issues, and you reply to act on it ("create Linear issues for #1 and #2 and assign them to me"). Between digests it keeps working the repo: summarizing new pull requests, answering @mentions, and handling the Linear issues you delegate. You stay in your inbox, Kody works the tracker.

- **Digests your issue tracker weekly.** A cron schedule fetches all open issues on your repo, groups them (needs attention, recent activity, stale), cites every issue as #N, and sends the digest by email through the Resend MCP tools.
- **Acts on email replies.** Inbound replies land on the Resend chat channel; the agent resolves the referenced issue numbers against GitHub, does what was asked (comment, label, close, create Linear issues), and replies on the same thread.
- **Summarizes new pull requests.** When a PR opens, Kody posts one orienting comment: what the PR does and why, plus a table breaking down the changed files. PRs opened by bots are skipped.
- **Works in Linear.** Delegate issues to the agent or mention it in Linear Agent Sessions ("email me a summary of this issue"), and it works the issue with the Linear MCP tools.
- **Answers GitHub mentions.** @Kody on an issue or PR gets an in-thread reply, cross-referencing Linear when it helps.
- **Remembers your preferences.** Standing preferences (a preferred email address, how you like the digest grouped, a default Linear team) live in Vercel Blob, keyed to the resolved principal.

Deploying with the button provisions everything the agent needs and wires it up for you:

- a **GitHub** connector (sets `GITHUB_CONNECTOR`, with the trigger pointed at `/eve/v1/github`),
- a **Linear** connector (sets `LINEAR_CONNECTOR`, with the trigger pointed at `/eve/v1/linear`),
- a **Vercel Blob** store for the preference tools,
- an **Upstash Redis** store (sets `REDIS_URL`) for the email channel's thread state,
- prompts for the Resend API key, webhook secret, sender address, and digest repo and recipient.

After it deploys, point Resend's inbound webhook at `https://<deployment>/eve/v1/resend` (see [Resend](#resend) below).

To set things up by hand instead, deploy with `eve deploy` (it wraps `vercel deploy --prod`; the raw command cannot auto-detect the eve framework) and provision the integrations first:

### GitHub and Linear connectors

Create the connectors with the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) and point their triggers at the routes the agent serves:

```bash
# GitHub connector (UID -> GITHUB_CONNECTOR); subscribe to issue_comment and
# pull_request_review_comment during registration for mention-driven turns
vercel connect create github --triggers
vercel connect attach <github-uid> --triggers --trigger-path /eve/v1/github --yes

# Linear connector (UID -> LINEAR_CONNECTOR); subscribe to the AgentSessionEvent
# webhook category during registration
vercel connect create linear --triggers
vercel connect attach <linear-uid> --triggers --trigger-path /eve/v1/linear --yes
```

Set `GITHUB_CONNECTOR` and `LINEAR_CONNECTOR` to the printed UIDs in the project's environment.

### Resend

Set `RESEND_API_KEY` (used by both the email channel and the Resend MCP connection) and `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, then point Resend's inbound webhook at `https://<deployment>/eve/v1/resend` so replies reach the agent. Set `RESEND_FROM_ADDRESS` to a verified sender on your Resend domain, and optionally `RESEND_FROM_NAME` (defaults to "Kody"); the email channel and the system prompt both read them, so every email the agent sends carries the same identity.

### Redis, Blob, and digest config

- `REDIS_URL`: thread state for the email channel (`@chat-adapter/state-redis`). Any Redis works; the [Upstash for Redis](https://vercel.com/marketplace/upstash/upstash-kv) marketplace integration sets the variable automatically when you connect a store.
- A Vercel Blob store connected to the project, for the preference tools: `vercel blob create-store <name> --access public --yes`.
- `DIGEST_REPO` (e.g. `owner/repo`) and `DIGEST_EMAIL`: what the weekly digest covers and who receives it. Both are required at build time; a missing value fails discovery with a clear error instead of deploying a digest that cannot send.

GitHub and Linear credentials are brokered by [Vercel Connect](https://vercel.com/docs/connect); Blob and the model authenticate with the project's [Vercel OIDC](https://vercel.com/docs/oidc) token. The only static credentials are the Resend API key and inbound webhook secret.

## Quick start with an AI coding agent

If you're working with an AI coding agent like Claude Code or Cursor, you can use this prompt to have it help you with building your agent:

## Pairing with the content agent template

The [eve content agent template](https://github.com/vercel-labs/eve-content-agent-template) is a full content assistant: per-surface style skills (blog, LinkedIn, X, release notes, newsletters), a house voice, and a style lint. Instead of merging all of that into Kody, you can deploy it as its own agent and let Kody delegate to it, through eve's [remote agents](https://eve.dev/docs/guides/remote-agents) feature, when repo work turns into writing work: release notes for a shipped fix, or a post announcing a feature that just closed out.

1. Deploy the content agent template as its own Vercel project.
2. Add a remote subagent file to this repo. The filename is the tool name, and `vercelOidc()` handles deployment-to-deployment auth with no shared secret:

```ts
// agent/subagents/content_writer.ts
import { defineRemoteAgent } from "eve";
import { vercelOidc } from "eve/agents/auth";

export default defineRemoteAgent({
  url: () => process.env.CONTENT_AGENT_URL ?? "https://your-content-agent.vercel.app",
  description:
    "Drafts blog posts, LinkedIn and X posts, release notes, and newsletters in the house voice. " +
    "Pass the surface, the source material, and any constraints in the message.",
  auth: vercelOidc(),
});
```

3. Set `CONTENT_AGENT_URL` in this project's environment and mention the new subagent in `agent/instructions.ts` so Kody knows when to hand off.

The remote agent runs in its own deployment with its own skills and connections, and it never sees Kody's conversation history, so Kody packs everything the writer needs into the call `message`: the issues or PRs the piece covers, the audience, and the surface. The result comes back as a normal tool result, the same shape as the local `researcher` subagent.

## Local development

Link the project you deployed (or a fresh one) and pull its environment:

```bash
vercel link
vercel env pull
```

Then run the development server and link a model provider with `/model` in the TUI:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

You can chat with the agent directly in the dev TUI to exercise the GitHub tools, the Linear and Resend connections, and the preference tools. The webhook surfaces (GitHub mentions, Linear sessions, email replies) run against a deployment.

`eve dev` never fires schedules on their cron cadence. Trigger the digest by hand with the dev dispatch route:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/eve/v1/dev/schedules/weekly-digest
```

Ship changes with:

```bash
eve deploy
```

### Linting and formatting

This project uses [Ultracite](https://www.ultracite.ai/) (a [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) preset) for linting and formatting:

```bash
pnpm check      # check formatting and lint rules
pnpm fix        # auto-fix what is fixable
pnpm validate   # lint + typecheck + eve discovery diagnostics
```

## Customizing

- **Behavior:** edit `agent/instructions.ts`. It describes the whole workflow: ground everything in the real tracker, the weekly digest shape, acting on email replies, Linear sessions, and GitHub mentions. The sending-email rule resolves `RESEND_FROM_ADDRESS` at build time.
- **The digest:** the cron expression, subject line, and recipient live in `agent/schedules/weekly-digest.ts`; the digest's structure (grouping, needs-attention and stale criteria, one-line summaries) lives in `agent/skills/digest-format/SKILL.md`.
- **PR summaries:** the `onPullRequest` hook and its task prompt live in `agent/channels/github.ts`. Adjust the dispatch condition there (for example, to include bot PRs or drafts) or the comment's shape.
- **Approval gates:** `agent/tools/github.ts` sets `requireApproval: "never"` for the reversible issue-conversation writes because email cannot render an approval prompt; adjust the list to re-gate them. `clear_user_preferences` stays approval-gated.
- **Skills:** edit or add skills in `agent/skills/`. Each folder holds a `SKILL.md` plus its reference files.
- **Model:** edit `agent/agent.ts` (or run `/model` in the dev TUI).
- **Tools:** add or change tools in `agent/tools/`. The filename is the tool name.

The agent auto-updates as you edit these files.
